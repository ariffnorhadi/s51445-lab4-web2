This is my first full stack web development project I've ever built in my life. It is called the Insurance Management System. I submitted this assignments late. Maybe few months after the deadline. I'm just happy that I made it the best I can.

Step after you clone this project:
1. Open Xampp, on Apache and MySQL
2. Create database insurance (default) , then drag insurance.sql that you will find on the root directory of the project to the Xampp. This will import the sql file to your database
3. Run homepage.jsp at lab4_s51445\web\Exercise

There you go. Hope this will help you to start your journey as developer! Thanks!
