This is my first full stack web development project I've ever built in my life. It is called the Insurance Management System. I submitted this assignment late. Maybe few months after the deadline. I'm just happy that I made it the best I can.

Steps after you cloned/forked this project:
1. Open Xampp, on Apache and MySQL
2. Create database insurance (default) , then drag insurance.sql that you will find on the root directory of the project to the Xampp. This will import the sql file to your database
3. Run homepage.jsp at /web/Exercise

I used Netbeans IDE.

Also, you may have to configure MySQL.java at /src/java/lab4/Exercise based on your settings that you use.

Below is the default (my configuration)
String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/insurance";
String user = "root";
String password = "";

There you go. I hope this will help you to start your journey as a software developer! Thanks!
